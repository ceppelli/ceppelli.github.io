This are the Arduino boards I collected in the last 10 years.

![image](02.png){:class="img" style="border-radius: 8px; width:100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"}

I bought my first arduino board back in 2009: the `Arduino 2009`!!! I remember I was enthusiastic about it and since then I played quite bit with this platform, I had a lot of fun!!!

Here some of my boards:`Arduino 2009`, `Arduino Leonardo`, `Arduino UNO R3`, `Ethernet Shield`.

In the last years I switched to the new and more capable platforms: `Raspberry Pi`, `STM32`, `ESP32`.
