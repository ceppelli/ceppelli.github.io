# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!

# Ruby 3.0 no longer comes with webrick
# Hi! In general, we recommend (and support) running the github-pages gem
# with the Ruby version we're running in production (2.7.x). We don't yet
# support Ruby 3.0.0. Ruby 2.7.x still has webrick so I'd recommend using
# that until we've upgraded for your GitHub Pages needs!
